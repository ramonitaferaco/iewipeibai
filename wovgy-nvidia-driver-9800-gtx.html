I just downloaded the newest drivers from Nvidia and now none of my games work. After about 20-30 min of play the screen goes white and I get a notification that my driver stopped working but has recovered successfully, yet the game is frozen and I need to restart it. Sometimes the whole pc freezes and I do a hard reboot. Seems to be no solution and many other people are having this problem. I'm using a i5-760 and XFX GTX 9800+. Edit: I am using W7 64bit.

Sorry if this is a re-post. I searched for it, and a similar question came up, but they all started talking about Radeon hardware, so I just wanted to ask it myself to be sure about doing it with Nvidia hardware. Basically, I'm just wondering if I'm going to HAVE to use two Nvidia graphics card in order to use three monitors on my computer. I'm currently using dual monitors with my GTX 280, and I was just wondering if there was any way to get around having to get another GTX 280 to do triple. Минимальные системные требования.

Hi everyone, Since i've upgraded from my i7 4770k some time ago i've suffered from my CPU not performing as it should in games, recently i've had it run through some benchmark and realized that it's running like shit compared to other 7700K's. On Intels Extreme Tuning Utility I get a score of around 700 Marks while on Passmarks PerformanceTest 9.0 I get a score of 9800 (with the average i7 7700K scoring around 12500). This is the very bottom of performance on 7700K's.

This is an update to this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6rm3vy/vega_is_better_than_you_think/) that I made.

I visited my motherboard's drivers site ( here (https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/P43_Neo#down-driver&Win7%2064)) and it supports up to windows 7 only. Are these drivers enough or should I do something else? PC Specs: Motherboard: MSI MS-7519 CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9400 GPU: NVIDIA GeForce So I will try to keep this short and straight forward. I have a computer that would be considered old. I bought a new 4k TV. I have used a "older" tv for a monitor for awhile now (no problems/old monitor is probably 720p/1080i/1080p don't even really know). I just upgraded to a LG 43UJ62 4k UHD Smart Tv. I plugged computer into said monitor. The bios screen and initial windows loading screen shows up but when the screen comes up for login information- it goes blank, "No signal".

So i got a new laptop and I loaded ATS (and ETS2) on it. My old system was a core 2 duo @ 3.4ghz 8gb of DDR2 and a 9800m GTX (like a desktop 9800 GT). I could play at 720p on a low medium mix (only thing I leave on ultra is mirror distance) and get 35-50 FPS in cities and 60 FPS pegged on the open roads (cpu usage was in the 50% mark and GPU was 40-60%). I did the same settings on the new system and I get barely 30FPS on the open road and 14-20 FPS in cities. Even more frustrating 
Good evening, my glorious breathren! I'm assisting a friend in upgrading his PC, and we're running into an issue. He doesn't do much gaming, but what he DOES do, he'd like to do better. Mostly he plays World of Warcraft, but in the seven or so years he's been gone, they've updated their models and texture quality/resolution, so his older GPU isn't handling it quite the way it used to. Here's his current setup: Intel Core 2 Quad (can't remember the speed) 8 GB DDR2 800 EVGA Nforce Greetings, TFTS. It's been a while since the last time ( (and, incidentally, the first time) I've posted here. I've promised you a story, so here's another tale about exploits of an apprentice Computer Exorcist.

Okay, this thing is giving me heavy headaches from some time already, and I can't live up with this anymore. I have my GTX 970 since 28 of may, it's 3 months old. Since when I started using it, every game I used to play was perfect. Either at constant 60 fps or even more! At low temps, sometimes at a low gpu usage and sometimes at a fully 100% usage, but some thing have turned over since some time. After I discovered the existence of DSR (http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dsr/techno. The last time I owned an AMD card, it was an ATi. (9800 in all its glory) around this time I made the switch to nVidia and have been hooked with them since. Now, I'm by no means a fanboy I just have my preference when it came to nVidia. Part OCD / Part experience. I've pretty much avoided AMD because the last time I dealt with them I had issues with poor driver support and the fact that most games were sponsored/optimized for nVidia. Yesterday Newegg started the promotion for the R9 295x2. I just installed a sapphire dual x R9 280 Radeon graphics accelerator into my hp pavilion running windows vista which used to run an NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX+. I have a 550 watt power supply which is listed as the minimum required. I uninstalled and disabled my onboard graphics processor installed all the drivers on to the computer and then installed the graphics card. The sound works fine but my monitor which is an HP w 2408h will not turn on. It just says monitor going to sleep.

Hi all, I've been using a PC that's about 10 years old as a media server. I had a friend send me his Kingpin GTX 980 Ti, so I upgraded the power supply to an Evga Supernova 750w to support it. The PC had previously been running a Geforce 9800 GTX ( so it's pretty old. Old enough for there to be no on-board video on the motherboard (https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/M4A79XTD_EVO/).

Hey everyone. I was just scouring the Internet and found out that you can hook up an old Nvidia card and use it as a dedicated PhysX card. Now my question is whether having another card alongside a 7xx or 6xx series card is worth the extra power consumption if all it's doing is processing for PhysX. What's the toll of PhysX on a modern card to begin with? Can you expect any significant gain in performance? It's relatively easy to obtain a sub  GTX 260 on Ebay, so the money thing isn't really.
